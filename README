PLEASE READ

This directory contains the implementation of a -relatively simple -
dab/dab+ receiver.
The receiver supports terrestrial DAB reception with as input either
the stream from a dabstick, an AIRSPY or an SDRplay or a (prerecorded) file,
and it will output through the default soundcard.


Configuring
Devices are "in" or "out" by uncommenting resp. commenting out
the appropriate CONFIG = device lines in the ".pro" file
or setting DEVICE=true in the CMakeLists.txt file

setting 
CONFIG	+= spectrum 
will configure a shown spectrum in

Building:
As usual, a pre-compiled version for 64 bits Windows exists, and for Linux
one has to collect libraries and do the building oneself.

Libraries that are needed are

qwt		(6.2)
qt		(5 or more)
usbx		(1.0.14 used)
portaudio	0.19
fftw3f
rtlsdr
faad
sndfile

Two possibilities for building the software are there: the Qt qmake tools
or the CMake tools. Both have been tested on Fedora 19 and Fedora 20

QMake:
The dabreceiver.pro file assumes the availability of all libraries.

When using fedora (or Ubuntu), just install the required packages!!!

Running:

Normal way of running is through
  ./sdr-j-dabreceiver-0.99

(Note that running under Windows requires a Zadiq-set usb driver when
using a DAB stick)

Note on DABstick software

I had (far) better results using an RT820T based dabstick with generating
a library from 
http://www.rtl-sdr.com/new-experimental-r820t-rtl-sdr-driver-tunes-13-mhz-lower/

One may also look at the work of Leif for Linrad

http://www.sm5bsz.com/linuxdsp/hware/rtlsdr/rtlsdr.htm

There an alternative rtl-sdr library is available
