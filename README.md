# sdr-j-dab
SDR-J-DAB is a simple DAB "receiver"  that works with dabsticks and better with SDRplay and AIRSPY. 
It also supports the rtl_tcp server

Different devices can be included or excluded in the exectable
by commenting out (or uncommenting) the appropriate lines
in the configuration files

Note that for airspy you need to install the 1.07 version
